What is this?
This is stuff not used in my game Project Nortubel.
Some are simply placeholder files meant to be replaced, others are stuff that was replaced when something better came along.
In the last day or two of the game, I had to delete some files (And change most music/sound files to a different file type) to be able to upload the game to Itch and Newgrounds.
(Maybe only the sound file change was needed anyway).
However, these unused files are available here so people can see them.
Some unused files still exist in the game's files, such as an earlier version of the player and companion spriteset.
But I still brought those here just because.
Other images put here were some meant to be "demo end" images before every chapter was finalized.
